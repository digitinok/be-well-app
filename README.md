## Description

Be Well is a health application designed to promote healthy living habits among its users.\
It is a group project that aims to offer a range of features and functionalities to help users achieve their health goals.\
\
Be Well was created with the aim of helping people achieve their health goals and live a healthier lifestyle. Weâ€™ve recognized that there are many health applications available on the market, but they often lack a comprehensive approach and tend to focus on specific aspects of health, such as diet or exercise.\
\
To address this issue, the team decided to create an app that would provide users with a more holistic approach to health and wellness. By offering features such as BMI calculators, health tips, yoga tutorials, and healthy food recipes, the app can help users achieve their health goals in a more complete and sustainable way.
